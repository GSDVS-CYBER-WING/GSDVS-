# Labs

The labs consist of basic labs and advanced labs. In this session, we designed experimental courses from the perspective of system research. 

Encourage students to implement and optimize system modules by operating and applying mainstream and latest frameworks, platforms and tools to improve their ability to solve practical problems, not just understanding the use of tools.

## Basic Labs

||||
|---|---|---|
|<div style="width:50px">Lab No.</div>|Lab Name|Remarks|
|Lab 1|A simple end-to-end AI example, <br>from a system perspective|Understand the systems from debug info and system logs
|Lab 2|Customize operators|Design and implement a customized operator (both forward and backward) in python|
|Lab 3|CUDA implementation|Add a CUDA implementation for the customized operator|
|Lab 4|AllReduce implementation|Improve AllReduce on Horovod: implement a lossy compression (3LC) on GPU for low-bandwidth network|
|Lab 5|Configure containers for customized training and inference|Configure containers|
